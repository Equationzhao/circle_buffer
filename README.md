## This is a tiny c++ implementation of circular buffer (Circular linked list based).

## Features

- *Header Only*
- iterator support 
- constexpr support (in process)
- user-defined allocator support  
- user-defined deleter support (in process)
- module support (in process)
- concept support (in process)
- ranges support  
- initialization_list support (in process)

## Support Modifiers/Member access/Operators

* insert/emplace
* push
* assign (in process)
* write
* read
* at
* operator [ ]
* iterators :
  * iterator
  * const_iterator 
  * circular_iterator
  * reverse_iterator (in process)
  * const_reverse_iterator (in process)
* swap
* sort (in process)
* <=>
* clear (in process)
* resize (in process)
* . . .

## TODO LIST for now

* [// ? compare the T data it contains or  test  are they actually the "same object"](https://github.com/Equationzhao/circle_buffer/blob/9159b6e2eca5607fd9063f3a8db61c05f09d8187/circular_buffer.h#L85) Design Problem?
* test Iterators 
* Finish const_iterator / reversed_iterator (s)
