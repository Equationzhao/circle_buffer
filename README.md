## This is a tiny c++ implementation of circle buffer (Circular linked list based).

## Features

- iterator support (in process)
- constexpr support (in process)
- user-defined allocator support (in process)
- module support (in process)
- concept support (in process)
- ranges support (?)

* assign (in process)
* write
* read
* at (in process)
* operator []
* iterators :
  * iterator
